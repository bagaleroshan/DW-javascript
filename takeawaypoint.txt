day 1
js is  single threaded synchronous language
commented code will not run. eg:single line // (crt + /) and multiline /* */(shift+alt+A)


data 
string =>they are always wrapped by double quotes
number => 1,3,2.3
boolean =>true , false


operator
+,-,*,/,%

1+2=3
1+"2"="12"=>always string wins
in js operation are performed between two values
1+3+"3"+3+4=4334





day 2
variable 
   ->we must define variable before calling variable.
   ->variable name must be descriptive.  eg:let num1=2;
   ->always use camel case convention for naming variable. eg:isThisRight

->js is dynamic language because a variable can store different data at different time.


-> %(modulus) is reminder operator.

STRING
    =>it can be define by using single quotes or double quotes.
    =>we cannot use single quotes inside single quotes.
    =>we cannot use double quotes inside double quotes.

 

day 3 

conversion to boolean
all empty are falsy

=>string
""=>falsy
all are truthy

=>number 
0=>falsy
all are truthy


=>string can be define using '',"",``.
=>we can call variable inside `` using ${}but it is not possible in '',"".
=>we can not use ' inside "" and so on.

day 4
{
  ever curly braces is like new file
  we can define variable and call variable and so on
  but we cannot export variable  define inside curly braces
}

export by name
=>a file as many export.
=>need curly braces while import
=>while import you should use same name which is used while export
export by default
=>a file as only one export default
=>does not curly braces while import
=>while import you can use any name

###interview question
define js?
=>js is  single threaded and synchronous language.
ERROR
1+3+"3"+3+4=>4334
truthy and falsy
 
ERROR
  address is not define =>it means address variable is not define.


console.log("1")
setTimeout(()=>{
    console.log("hello")
},0)
console.log("2")
